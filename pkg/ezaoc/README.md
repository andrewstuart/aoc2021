As soon as go1.18beta1 was tagged, I realized Advent of Code 2021, which I was
in the middle of working on, would be the perfect non-production playground for
a lot of useful generics. Most of AOC is data structures and data parsing, which
makes it a pretty ideal but noncritical place to mess around with a new language
feature.

If you use this package, there is a small chance that minor versions (pre-1)
will make breaking changes but I've tried to get things right/most-flexible the
first time. Feel free to rip apart, ignore, or use to your heart's content. :-)
